\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we introduce two effective approaches for exploiting unlabeled frames in videos to improve semantic segmentation performance of indoor scenes. 
%
First, we propagate the labeled data to neighboring frames and generate a large number of reliable pseudo labels to scale up and enrich the training set.
%
Second, we present a training policy that takes advantage of temporal correlations between adjacent frames to enhance the performance of basic semantic segmentation model.
%
Experimental results on NYUD-v2 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods.  
%{\bf Future Work.} As we said in the discussion, the imbalance of sample classes results in the error of segmentation results. 
%
%Hence, our future work is still based on the data itself.
%
%One direction is how to balance sample categories, and the other is how to make more efficient and reasonable use of unlabeled video data.
